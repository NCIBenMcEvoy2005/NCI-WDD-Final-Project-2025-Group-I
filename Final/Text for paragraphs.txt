Marine Biodiversity
-------------------
1. Intro Paragraph

Marine Biodiversity is about the large amount of diverse speicies of fish, crustations, coral and underwater plants found within our oceans.
The ocean, being one of the largest parts of the earth, contains 2.2 million unique species of both creatures and plants making up 80% of the earths biodiversity.
Like the biodiversity found on the surface, the various fish and plants found below each work a delicate role to maintain the balance of their respective terratory
Many parts of the ocean contain various "hotspots" the are home to rare species that cannot be found anywhere else on the globe.
The biodiversity of the ocean gives our oceans the capability to be resiliant and adaptable to our mistakes on the surface and to keep unique varients from going extinct.
